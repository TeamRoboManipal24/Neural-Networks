# Neural-Networks
Implement a classification model using neural networks on the given dataset.
Everything is to be implemented in an .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) file.
(NOTE: Implement NN from scratch)
Some library recommendations:
Use NumPy or alternatives to process the matrix calculations
Use Pandas or alternatives to read/process the data
Use Matplotlib or alternatives to plot graphs

For the Neural Networks from scratch task do not use TensorFlow or PyTorch
